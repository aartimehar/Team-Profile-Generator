#  Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

##  Task

My task is to take the given starter code and convert it into a working Node.js command-line application. This application will take in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. I have been provided with tests, so  I will make sure every part of your code passes each provided test.

## User Story

As a Engineer a user want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that a user have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

## Installation

To run this program simply clone the repo from GitHub using the clone command,You can then use the command npm install to download the projects npm dependencies. This will output JavaScript files to the /dist directory which are used by node. Finally, to run the application, use the command npm start.This application also requires a file system and inquirer module. If testing is required, this application uses Jest.

NOTE: If you make any code changes, be sure to run npm run build again.

## Usage
Use inquirer from your command line to answer questions about your project.
Please follow these steps to use the application
